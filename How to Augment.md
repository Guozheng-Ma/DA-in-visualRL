# How to Augment the Data in Visual RL?


## 1 Observation Augmentation, Transition Augmentation and Trajectory Augmentation

### 1.1 Observation Augmentation

A typical approach to observation augmentation is applying the classical image manipulations to the observed images; and most such manipulations are originally proposed for computer vision applications.
